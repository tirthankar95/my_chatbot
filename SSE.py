It is believed to have originated around 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, an event that marked the beginning of space, time, and matter. The universe is constantly expanding, with billions of galaxies housing countless stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. It operates under fundamental forces and laws, such as gravity, which govern its behavior. Despite humanity's advancements in science and technology, much of the universe remains a mystery, with phenomena like dark matter and dark energy continuing to intrigue scientists and spark exploration. Its sheer scale and complexity make it one of the greatest marvels of existence."""
