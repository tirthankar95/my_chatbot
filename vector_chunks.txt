 Reference is invi
ted to this Department OM no. 24(35)/PF-II/2012 dated 29th Aug, 
2014 regarding the guidelines for formulation, appraisal and approval of Public Funded 
Plan Schemes and Projects. With the announcement in the Union Budget 2016-17 of 
doing away with Plan Non-Plan distinction at the end of Twelfth Five-year Plan, it is 
imperative that a plan non-Plan neutral appraisal and approval system is put into place. 
After a comprehensive review of the extant guidelines in this regard, the revised

Content: guidelines placed below will henceforth apply to the formulation, appraisal and approval 
of public funded schemes and projects, except matters required to be placed before the 
Cabinet Committee on Security. 
2 Schemes: are program based cost centres through which the Ministries and 
Departments spend their budgetary and extra-budgetary resources for delivery of public 
goods and services to the citizens. They are of two types: 
a) Central sector schemes are implemented by the Central  Ministries/Departments
through their designated implementation agencies and funds are routed through the 
functional h eads relevant for the sector.
b) Centrally Sponsored Schemes are implemented within the domain of National
Development Agenda identified by the Committee of Chief Ministers constituted by NITI 
Aayog. They can have both Central and State Components. While the former are fully 
funded by the Central Government and implemented through functional heads like the

Content: central sector schemes in para-a above, the latter are routed through the inter-
governmental transfer heads 3601/3602. The expenditure on State Components is 
shared between the Central and State Governments in accordance with the fund 
sharing pattern approved for the purpose. 
3. Projects: are best understood by the common-sense usage of the term. They involve
one time expenditure resulting in creation of capital assets, which could yield financial 
or economic returns or both. Projects may either be approved on stand-alone basis or 
as individual projects within an approved scheme envelope. They may be executed 
through budgetary, extra-budgetary resources, or a combination of both.

4. Rationalization: It was found that over the years Ministries/Departments had started
operating small and multiple schemes, which spread resources too thinly to realize any 
meaningful outcomes. In the run up to the Union Budget 2016-17, Schemes were 
rationalized  in consultation with the implementing Ministries/Departments. As per para-
113 of the Budget Speech 2016, the number of Central Sector Schemes was brought 
down to around 300 and the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes to around 30. 
However, this exercise is not an end in itself. In reiteration of the standing instructions 
in this regard and to ensure efficient management of public expenditure at all times, it 
is directed that henceforth: 
i. No new S
cheme or Sub-Scheme will be initiated without the prior “in-principle”
approval of the Department of Expenditure. This will, however, not apply to the

ii. The Stat
ement of Budget Estimates should be prepared in accordance with the
approved scheme architecture and any deviation in this regard should be a
priori agreed with the concerned division of the Department of Expenditure.
iii. Administrative Ministries/Departments should continuously endeavo ur to
merge, restructure or drop existing schemes and sub-schemes that have
become redundant or in effective with the passage of time. For this, the
restriction of in-principle approval mentioned i n para-(i) above w ill not apply.
iv. Departm
ent of Expenditure reserves the right to merge, restructure or drop any
existing scheme or sub-scheme, in consultation with the Administrative
Department concerned, to enhance efficiency and improve economies of scale
in the execution of government programs.

over- runs, often resulting in a series of revised cost estimates. Additional time
and effort spent at the scheme/project formulation stage can not only save
precious resources, but also enhance the overall impact, leading to a qualitative
improvement in outcomes.
For all new Schemes, a Concept Paper should be prepared while seeking in-
principle  approval, holding stakeholder consultations, conduct of pilot studies etc. 
While submitting. proposals for continuation of on-going schemes, a careful 
rationalization must be done through merger and dropping of redundant schemes. The 
feedback from the formulation stage should be used for improving the scheme design 
so that a Detailed Paper can be presented for appraisal a t the EFC stage. 
Similarly, 
project preparation should commence with a Feasibility Report, which

the Financial Adviser concerned after examining project feasibility and availability of 
financial resources. 
Generic structure of a Detailed Paper for Schemes/Detailed Project Report for  
Projects is given at Annex-I . While designing new schemes/sub-schemes, the core 
principles  to be kept in mind are economies of scale, separability of outcomes and 
sharing of implementation machinery. Schemes which share outcomes and 
implementation machinery   should not be posed as independent schemes, but within a 
unified umbrella program with carefully designed convergence frameworks.

framework for schemes and their sunset dates will become coterminous with the Finance 
Commission Cycles, the first such one being the remaining Fourteenth Finance Commission

outlay needs a clarity over flow of resources, which is likely to be available to both Central and 
State Governments over the Finance Commission periods. 
       Accordingly, it is directed that at the end of the Twelfth Plan period all Ministries/ 
Departments should undertake an outcome review and re-submit their Schemes for appraisal 
and approval, unless the scheme has already been made coterminous with FFC period. The 
Department of Expenditure will, on its part, communicate, in consultation with the Budget 
Division, the outlays for both Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes over the 
remaining FFC period. The same process will, mutatis mutandis, apply to the subsequent 
Finance Commission Cycles.

Ministries/Department to prepare an outp outcome framework for each Central Sector and 
Centrally Sponsored Scheme with the approval of CEO NITI Aayog. Measurable outcomes, 
which deal with the quality aspect of schemes and programs, need to be defined over the 
relevant medium term framework, while physical and financial outputs need to be targeted on 
year-to-year basis in such a manner that it aggregates to achieve the measurable outcomes

mid- term or post-project should be clearly spelt out. It may be noted that continuation of 
schemes from one period to another will not be permissible without a third-party evaluation. 
Last but not the least, a self-contained Executive Summary should be placed at the 
beginning of the document. In cases where only a Concept Paper or Feasibility Report is  
attached to the EFC/PIB proposal, it should cover the main points mentioned in the generic

Dear Secretary, 
As you are 
aware, proposals relating 
to Revised Cost Estimates (RCEs) due to time and

or extension in time frame of implementation of various projects/ schemes are placed 
for consideration of Cabinet/Cabinet Committees. The Department of  Expenditure have laid down 
detailed guidelines for appraisal of RCE proposals and specified  the appraisal and approval for a 
based on the financial threshold of such proposals. 
2. After approval of pro
jects/schemes by the competent authority, it is expected that  the
Ministries/De

are avoided and remedial steps taken, whenever required.

Committees for their consideration and approval. In this context, it has now been decided that 
all such proposals must necessarily incorporate in the                                 Note for Cabinet/Cabinet Committees, 
specific physical and financial milestones with corresponding half yearly targets for their 
implementation. In the event of any slippage from adherence to these specified targets at the end 
of every six months, the Cabinet/ Cabinet committees would need to be apprised of the reasons 
for such slippage along with the strategy to achieve the targets.

 authority, the same
procedure may 
be adopted and the matter be placed before the appropriate approval authority.

It has 
been noticed that the process of appraisal of public funded schemes through 
Standing
 Finance Comm ittees/
Delegated Investment Boards is of late being carried out in a 
manner,
 not keeping in view the spirit of this Department’s O.M dated 5.8.2016 on the subject. It 
has been 
observed that inadequate time is given for appraisal of the SFC proposals and of ten 
Ministr
ies do not complete inter -ministeria

have been 
found to be ignored in the final SFC Memorandum. Further, SFC/DIB meetings are 
being f
ixed at extremely short notice, sometimes even before comments have

 It is expected that adequate diligence
 will be done by both programme divisions of

the qual

is sufficient to award a contracts on nomination basis rather than the inevitability of the situation, 
as emphasized in the circular.

time and place of auction, subject matter of auction, technical specifications, estimated cost,

tender is to ensure transparency in the public procurement, to maximize economy and efficiency in 
Government procurement, to promote healthy competition among the tenderers, to provide for fair 
and equitable treatment of all tenderers, and to eliminate irregularities, interference and corrupt 
practices by the authorities concerned. This is required by Article 14 of the Constitution. However, 
in rare and exceptional cases, for instance, during natural calamities and emergencies declared by

Management Institute (PMI- USA) has

Content: organizations use the concept of process as 
an integral part of project management. A large 
number of project firms have adopted this 
standard for improving competen ce of their 
manpower. ISO and PMI segregate 
project processes into five  process groups 
with some minor variances in labelling. The 
differences between the two standards are 
minimal with respect to process groups 
and subjects/ knowledge areas. The 
substantive difference in the two standards 
is with the detail and description   of tools 
and techniques, because ISO 21500:2012 do 
not provide it. The 47 project management 
processes identified in the PMBOK® 
Guide are further grouped into ten separate 
Knowledge Areas. Knowledge Area 
represents a complete set of concepts, terms, 
and activities that make up a      professional
field, project management field. or

OFFICE MEMORANDUM 
Subject: P
redatory Pricing/Abnormally Low Bids-Reg. 
It has 
come to the notice of this Department that procurement entities are facing 
difficulties in finalization of tenders, in cases of predatory pricing/ abnormally low bids. 
In this connection, para 7.5.7 of the Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017 issued by 
Department of Expenditure is being reiterated for information: 
An Abnormally Low Bid is one in which the bid price, in combination with other 
elements of the Bid, appears so low that it raises material conce rns as to the capability 
of the bidder to perform the contract at the offered price. Procuring Entity may in such

Chunk Id 263:
Content: cases seek written clarifications from the bidder, including detailed price analyses of its 
bid price in relation to scope, schedule, allocation of risks  and responsibilities, and any 
o
ther requirements of the bids document. If, after evaluating the price analyses, 
Procuring Entity determines that the bidder has substantially failed to demonstrate its 
capability to deliver the contract at the offered  price, the Procuring Entity may reject 
the bid/proposal. However it would not be advisable to fix a normative percentage 
below the estimated cost, which would be automatically be considered as an 
abnormally low bid. Due care should be taken while formulating the specifications at 
the time of preparation of bid document so as to have a safeguard against the 
submission of abnormally low bid from the bidder.

Content: not possess requisite skills in making procurement decisions. It delays the procurement 
process. At the same time, for usually low value procurements, efforts expended in 
assessing reasonability of rates may be disproportionate. Additionally, with developments 
in technology and e-procurement becoming the norm, availability of market data and 
capability to analyze it artificially, has provided an opportunity to automate decision 
making activities,
 like assessment of reasonability of rates in such cases. 
3. In view of above,
 it has been decided to start “Push Button Procurement (PBP)” for
small value procurements purely on experimental basis, for one year from date of launch 
by GeM, with the following conditions: 
(a) PBP will be mad e only on GeM through bidding (PBP through Direct Purchase, L-

the extent of vacancies left unfilled in the higher post. "The following guidelines must be 
followed in this regard: - 
I. The dispensation for down-gradation of posts may be exercised

--------------------------------------------------
Chunk Id 324:
Content: prescribed in Recruitment Rules. 
II. The dispensation for down-gradation of posts may also be
exercised when it is not possible to obtain relaxation in qualifying
service due to the fact that relaxation required from DoP&T is for
a period of more than one year. The higher-level posts, to be
operated on lower level, should be directly in the hierarchy of the
lower post;
III. Total number of sanction posts in the feeder grade and in the higher
grade in a cadre should not exceed the combined sanctioned
strength of two grades where such operation of posts at lower level is
considered.
IV. This may be done in consultation with Financial Adviser of
concerned Ministry/Depa
rtment.
2. This issues with the approval of Finance Minister.

Subject:- Procedure for offering/accepting post retirement 
contractual employments/ assignment or consultancy etc.-reg. 
It has been observed that sometimes, government organizations, in order to meet their 
functional requirement, use the expertise of retired government officials by hiring them on 
contractual basis, in the capacity of advisor/consultant etc. There is no defined procedure for 
seeking vigilance inputs before engaging retired government officials from the organizations 
where such retired officials were employed on full time basis, prior to their retirement.

Content: 2. Central Vigilance Commission has observed that the absence of a uniform defined procedure
for obtaining vigilance clearance, before engaging retired officials by government organizations , 
sometimes lead to a situation where officials with tainted past or having cases pending against them are 
engaged by the government organizations. Such a situation not only leads to unnecessary 
complaints/allegations of favoritism, but is also against the tenets of fairness  and probity which is the basic 
principle governing the functioning of government organizations.  
3. The Commission has therefore decided to formulate a defined procedure before engaging
a retired government official on contractual/consultancy basis by government organizations. The 
procedure to be adopted would include the following steps: -

communication by Speed Post to them, a reminder may be sent to them for expediting
vigilance clearance. However, in case no reply is received from the erstwhile employer within 
21 days of sending initial communication to them, it may be considered as ‘deemed 
vigilance clearance for the person concerned. Later on, if it is found that the ex-employee was 
involved in any vigilance related matter or was not clear from vigilance point of view, the 
erstwhile employer organization would be responsible for all consequential actions.

regarding. 
The undersigned is directed to say that the criteria for grant of extension/re- 
employment to Central Government employees beyond the age of 
superannuation are  laid down in the DoPT O.M. No. 26011/1/77-Estt. (B) dated 
the 18th May, 1977. After May, 1998 and when the age of retirement of the 
Central Government employees increased from 58 to 60 years, some of the

2. In the absence of specific order to the contrary by the competent authority,
a   Government servant must retire on the due date. The date of superannuation 
of a Government servant is known in advance and ordinarily there should not be 
a question of failure to make arrangement for his release sufficiently in advance. 
It is the  responsibility of the administrative authority concerned to ensure that 
the Government servants under their control retire o n the due date. 
3. Extension: F.R. 56(d) states that no Government servant shall be granted
extension of service beyond the age of 60 years. However, provision s exist in
the rules to grant extension of service to certain category of Government 
servants only. Therefore, it must be ensured that no Ministry/Department should 
propose to grant extension i n service unless the case i s covered b y the Rules.

5. Procedure for consideration of cases for extension of specialist
s in the
medical and    scientific fields: 
It should be appreciated that even in the case of extension to specialist in the 
medical or scientific fields, it is not only the next man who misses promotion but often 
several people miss consequential promotions all along the hierarchy. Thus, too 
many cases of extension in  service or re-employment are likely to cause frustration 
and affect the morale of the upcoming scientists who have exposure to latest 
technological developments in connecting fields. Keeping in view these 
circumstances, the following criteria and procedure has been evolved with a view to 
ensure that extension in service to the superannuating scientists are resorted to only 
in really exceptional circumstances. The overriding consideration for the grant of

Content: extension is that it must be in the public interest and in addition satisfy one of the 
following two conditions: - 
i) that the retiring speciali
st is not just one of the outstandin
g officers but is
really head and shoulders above the rest; or
ii) that other specialis
ts are not ripe enough to take over the job.
Test (ii) would be satisfied only if there is shortage in particular specialization, or 
if it is not possible to find a suitable successor or if the specialist is engaged on 
a work or project of vital importance, which is likely to produce results in a year 
or two. If specialists in the next lower post are not eligible for promotion on the 
ground that they have not put in the minimum service in the lower grade 
prescribed under the rules, no promotions can b e made to the higher grade, 
unless such specialist s put in the requisite length of service. But specialist who 
are eligible for promotion to the post against which extension is recommended,

experience as the retiring specialist. They should be considered for promotion 
according the recruitment rules and if they are found suitable they should be 
promoted to the posts being vacated by the retiring specialists.  
6. Wheneve
r any specialist is considered for grant of extension, his character roll
and personal file should be carefully scrutinized and all other relevant information 
that may be available should be taken into account to judge whether the specialist 
had good reputation for integrity and honesty. In cases where the specialist is not 
considered to have good reputation for integrity and honesty, he should not be
considered for grant for extension in service. The appropriate authority in the 
Administrative Ministry should furnish a certificate of Integrity along with the 
Annexure - I as follows where it proposes to grant extension of service.

Chunk Id 415:
Content: 2014 ibid has, inter-alia, observed as under: 
“7. Having examined a number of judgments rendered by this Court, we are of the 
view, that orders passed by the employer by seeking recovery of monetary benefits 
wrongly extended to employees, can only be interfered with, in cases where such 
recovery would result in a hardship of a nature, which would far outweigh, the equitable 
balance of the employer's right to recover. In other words, interference would be called for, 
only in such cases where, It would be iniquitous to recover the payment made. In order 
to ascertain the parameters of the above consideration, and the test to be applied, 
reference needs to be made to situations when this Court exempted employees from such

Dear Secretary 
I would like to draw your attention to this Secretariat's D.O. letter No. 6/1/1/94- 
Cab. dated 25.02.1994 (copy enclosed) wherein it was mentioned that the business 
of the Government of India is transacted in the Ministries and Departments in 
accordance with the Allocation of Business Rules, 1961. As the Ministries and 
Departments conduct  the 'allocated' business on behalf of the Government of 
India, all Ministries/Departments were requested to ensure that (i) a unified stand 
is taken before Courts of Law rather than bringing out the point of view of each 
Ministry/Department in the counter-affidavit/reply; and (ii) a common counter-reply is 
filed on behalf of the Union of India by the Ministry/Department concerned instead of

judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court identified five situations wherein recovery of excess 
payment made would be impermissible in Law. One of the situations  where recovery of excess 
payment has been decided to be impermissible relates to  the employees belonging to Class-Ill 
and Class- IV Service (or Group ‘C’  and Group ‘D’  Services). The Hon’ble Tribunal has noted

4. In this cont
ext, it is  observed tha
t the time taken by the Ministries/Departments/  Offices to
discover mistakes/clerical faults in pay fixation of their employees is highly  avoidabl e. The 
situation of overpay ments occurs on account of erroneous calculation of payments due to an 
employee. If not detected in time , amount becoming due for recovery due to these excess 
payments keep accruing. In many cases, these overpayments  come to no tice of the 
administrative authority at a very late stage resulting in substantial amounts becoming due for 
recovery. However, in the wake of the Order dated 18.12.2014   of the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
referred above, these recoveries are to be considered for  waiver in the types of cases identified

Sometimes, references are made to the nodal ministries/departments dealing with policy 
matters at the eleventh hour, i.e. a few days before the last date fixed by the Court/
Tribunal. This does not give sufficient time to these Ministries/ Departments to carefully 
examine the issues involved. It is, therefore, stressed that on receipt of the Notice along 
with the origin al Application/Petition, the Administrative  Department/ Authority should 
immediately prepare para-wise comments /counter- affidavit. Wherever necessary, the 
specific points on which comments of other nodal Departments like Department of 
Expenditure, Department of Personnel & Training, Department of Pensions and 
Pensioners’ Welfare, etc. are required may be brought out clearly. There upon, 
reference should be made to the concerned nodal Ministry/Department on priority basis.

absent themselves from hearings without valid reasons. Further, the Ministry should 
ensure arrangements for appearance before the Court/Tribunal as and when the matter 
comes for hearing and for this purpose proper liaison with the Government counsel 
should always be maintained. In addition, the Counsels must necessarily be briefed 
thoroughly before they attend Court proceedings.

4.1 Supernumerary P
osts: 
The following principles should be observed while creating supernumerary posts: 
a. The supernum
erary posts are created fo
r the purpose of accommodating the lien  of a
Government
 servant who, though enti
tled to hold a lien against the regular  post, cannot
be so accommodated because of non-availabili
ty of such a post.
b. The supernu merary post is a shadow post, i.e. no duties are attached to such a  post. The
supernumerary post is created for a definite and fixed period. Since, a supernumerary
post is created for accommodating an officer till he is absorbed in  a regular post , it
should not  be created for an indefinite period.
c. The supernumerary post is personal to the officer for whom it is created and no other officer can

created vacates it on account of retirement or is accommodated  in ano ther regular post.
In other words, no officiating arrangements can be made  against such a post.
d. Administrative authorities should maintain a record of the supernumerary posts , the
particulars of the individuals who hold liens against them and the progressive abolition of
such posts as and when the holder of the posts retire or are absorbed  in regular
permanent  posts, for the purpose o f verification o f service for pension .
5.1 Deemed Abolition & Revival of posts: 
a. All posts,
 except newly created posts, kept in abeyance or remaining vacant  for a
period of 
more than 2 years in any Ministry/ Department/ Attached office/  Subordinate 
office/Statutor

sidered as ‘deemed abolished’ unless an exemption

the provisions of the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules,2016, [i n short 
CCS(RP)Rules,2016]  as the frequent references on such issues  continue to be received in this 
Department. 
2. Consequent upon

the followi

(i) In 
order to remove the anomaly of a Government servant promoted or appointed to a higher 
post on or after 1-1-2016 drawing lower pay in that post than another Government  servant 
junior to him in the lower grade and promoted or appointed subsequently to another identical 
post, the pay of the senior Government servant in the higher post should be stepped up to a 
figure equal to the pay as fixed for the junior Government servant in that higher post. The 
stepping up should be done with effect from the date of promotion or appointment of the junior

Content: Government servant and will be subject to the following conditions, namely: 
(a) both the junior and the
 senior Government servants should belong to the same cadre and 
the posts 
in which they have been promoted are identical in the same cadre; 
(b) the Level in the Pay Matrix of the lower and higher posts in which they are entitled   to 
draw  pay 
should be identical; 
(c) the anomaly is directly as a result of the application of the provisions of Fundamental 
Rule 22(1)(a)(1) read with Rule 13 of CCS(RP)Rules,2016. For example, if the junior officer 
was drawing more pay in the existing pay structure than the senior by virtue of any advance 
increments granted to him, the provisions of this sub-rule should not be invoked to step up 
the pay of the senior officer.

the next increment on completion of his required qualifying service with effect from the date of 
re-fixation of pay. 
3. The fol lowing instances/events wherein juniors draw more pay than seniors,  do not
constitute anomaly and, therefore, stepping up of pay will not be admissible in such events: 
(a) Where senior proceeds on Extra Ordinary Leave which results in postponement  of his Date
of Next Increment in the lower post and consequently, he starts drawing less pay than his 
junior in the lower grade itself. He, therefore, cannot claim pay parity on promotion even 
though he may be promoted earlier to the higher grade than his junior(s);

pay may get fixed at a higher stage than that of a senior direct recruit appointed to the 
same higher grade and whose pay is fixed under different set of rules. For example, a 
Senior Secretariat Assistant (SSA)on promotion to the post of Assistant Section Officer 
(ASO) gets his pay fixed under FR 22(I)(a)(1) with reference to the pay drawn in the post 
of SSA, whereas the pay of ASO(DR) is fixed under Rule 8 of CCS(RP)Rules,2016 at 
the minimum pay or the first Cell in the Level, applicable to ASO to which he is 
appointed. In such a case, the senior ASO (DR) cannot claim pay parity with that of the
